Hi all!
My name is Pavel and this is my self-introduction video.
I was born in Grodno, Belarus in 1987. 

when i was 18, I graduated from the city gymnasium with a degree in physics and mathematics. Perhaps this is my starting point on the way to IT.

Starting from the fifth grade, every year I took part in school olympiads in mathematics and won prizes several times.

Since my school years, I loved to solve difficult problems, to find interesting solutions. These skills helped me to solve problems on codewars.

In 2005, I entered the Grodno State University, the Faculty of Economics, specializing in finance. From the first weeks of studenthood, I became an assistant teacher in higher mathematics.

I Conducted practical classes, and helped weak students in preparing for exams, thereby developing my stress tolerance and patience.

At the same time, I became an actor in student theater, where I was introduced to the concepts of brainstorming, teamwork, and overcoming stage fright.

After few years, from an actor, I became a screenwriter and director of performances, gathering a team of talented people around me, developing my leadership skills. (if you are interested in the topic of leadership, I recommend John Maxwell's book "The 21 Undeniable Laws of Leadership")

My professional experience began in 2010 as an economist at JSC GrodnoKhimvolokno. There was always a desire to automate that part of my duties that I could automate. In my tables, I always thought through the logic, and wrote down the necessary connections and formulas.

While I was working at the enterprise, in 2012 I became a tutor in mathematics, which I have been doing to this day.
One day, I just realized that when I reached my ceiling of possibilities at the —Åurrent workplace, I had a desire to break through this ceiling and become a better person. In this area, IT for me is a new opportunity for which life was preparing me.
I hope that thanks to the knowledge gained in RSSchool , I will be able to find a new job with the opportunity to develop and self-develop.

In my spare time I like to participate in intellectual competitions (superquiz, brainquiz and others), and learn to play the guitar.
Thank you all for your attention.
I look forward to your feedback.
